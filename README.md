# credit-risk-classification

## Objective:
The objective of this analysis was to use historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build and train a model than can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

The features included in the data used to determine the loan status were loan amount, interest rate, income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory remarks, and total debt.

The data was split into testing and training. The testing set was put through a LinearRegression model to determine if the model with the aim of determining whether a borrower was a low (0) or high (1) risk of defaulting on a loan. 

## Results:
The overall accuracy of the model was 99%. 
* Low risk: Precision 100%, Recall 99%, F1-score 100%, Support 18765
* High risk: Precision 85%, Recall 91%, F1-score 88%, Suppot 619
